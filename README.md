Can we measure stellar radii using lunar occultations?
======================================================

The Python script in this repository determines 
whether a 450 Hz camera can observe multiple frames
during the partial occulation of a star by the moon.

If the begin and end time of a partial occultation can be measured,
it could be used to determine the radius of the star accurately,
and hence the radius of its transiting planets.
